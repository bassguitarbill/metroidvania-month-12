THEME: What kills you makes you stronger
- Swap out enhancements to your body / mech / whatever
  - These enhancements lower your max health but provide you with MV abilities
  - Do you take the grappling hook to access the top path? Or do you equip heat resistance and tank the damage down below?
  - Focus on the speed / endurance dichotomy
    - Most powers give you speedy ways to get around but lower your ability to withstand continuous damage
    - Some powers (shield, heat resistance) don't provide movement but instead allow you to withstand damage
  - Maxing out the powers you have can make it OHKO mode
  - Swap out different powers at save points, allows you to try new combos quickly
  - Without any MVs equipped, the character should have
    - A slow, weak melee attack
    - A decent running speed
    - A single jump
    - Maybe the ability to crouch
    - A goodly amount of health
  - Abilities should be limited by both the amount of health you have, and the number of slots
    - Some power ups should just be life increases, but allowing the player to equip infinity of them would be silly
  - Life bar made up of individual units
    - Getting shot will take away a discrete number of units
    - Env damage will chip away at a single unit: when it's gone the unit goes away, but if you get to safety, you heal it
  - Who are you?
    - You're a biological experiment / robit that is trying to escape a lab
      - Bosses could be different versions of you with different powerups
        - Mega Man style
      - Have to decide whether I want the art style of the main character to be clean or icky
        - Clean = Samus Aran in Super Metroid, Clumsy Robot in Earthbound
          - Probably easier to show upgrades as part of the player sprite
          - Easier to design
        - Icky = Acrid in Risk of Rain
          - Will look cooler I think, and maybe we don't need to change the sprite
          - Might be tough to design something distinctive
    - You're a soldier equipped with experimental technology
    - You're a spirit of some kind, a ghost, or a lich
    - You're an italian chef
      - I don't know how feasible this would be
  - Customize your sprite
    - When loading the character image, apply a hue offset to certain pixels of the image, then use the offset version (no shaders!)
      - Maybe a second hue for your blood / acid / Tang
  - MV Abilities:
    - Electric burst
      - Stuns nearby enemies
      - Overloads electric locks on doors
    - All Fours
      - Allows faster movement
      - Pounce attack
    - A Gun
      - Ranged attacks
      - Shoot a target
